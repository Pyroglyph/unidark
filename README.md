# Unidark

A tiny tool to activate the dark theme on the free version of Unity!


## Why?

For a long time, Unity's free users have been forced to either use the light theme or buy Pro. Everyone knows that using light themes can cause eye strain (especially in dark environments), yet Unity has consistently kept their dark theme behind a paywall and has been ignoring the community about it for *years*.

So, I decided to do something about it. Enter **Unidark**.


## How to Use

First, either [download the latest version](https://github.com/Pyroglyph/unidark/releases) or compile Unidark from source.

### Method A

1. Open Unidark.exe
2. Follow the on-screen prompts.
3. You're done!

### Method B

1. Drop Unity.exe (or a shortcut to it) onto Unidark.exe
2. Wait for Unidark to complete.
3. You're done!


## Troubleshooting

If Unidark complains about not being able to open Unity.exe, it probably doesn't have permission to access Unity's folder. Running Unidark as an administrator should solve this:

1. Right-click on Unidark.exe
2. Click the 'Compatibility' tab.
3. Check the 'Run this program as an administrator' box.
4. Click 'OK'.
5. Try using Unidark again.

Is something else not working right? Are you getting cryptic error messages? [Create an issue](https://github.com/Pyroglyph/unidark/issues/new) about it! Make sure it's reproducible and remember to include the version of Unity you're using, otherwise I won't be able to help.

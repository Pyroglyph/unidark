# Unidark

A tiny tool to activate the dark theme on the free version of Unity!


## Why?

For a long time, Unity's free users have been forced to either use the light theme or buy Pro. Everyone knows that using light themes can cause eye strain (especially in dark environments), yet Unity has consistently kept their dark theme behind a paywall and has been ignoring the community about it for *years*.

So, I decided to do something about it. Enter **Unidark**.


## How to Use

1. Either [download the latest version](https://github.com/Pyroglyph/unidark/releases) or compile Unidark from source.
2. Drop your Unity.exe onto Unidark.exe
3. Wait for Unidark to finish working.
4. You're done!


## Stuff I need to do before releasing

- [x] Make it work in the first place
- [x] Make it more obvious to users when Unidark has succeeded/failed
- [ ] Add support for shortcuts that point to Unity.exe rather than just the exe itself
- [x] Auto-detect if Unity.exe has already been patched (and offer to reverse it)
- [ ] Check for existing Unity installations so you don't have to go hunting by yourself
